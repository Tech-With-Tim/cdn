## 🏁 Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [Running with Docker](#-running-with-docker) if you want to setup the CDN faster with Docker. ( Docker is optional )

### Environment variables

Set the environment variables. Start by writing this in a file named `app.env` and `test.env`:
(test.env is required for running tests)

app.env and test.env should look like this:

```prolog
DB_URI=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname?sslmode=disable
SECRET_KEY=secret
MAX_FILE_SIZE=30
```
- ``SECRET_KEY`` is the key used for the JWT token encoding.
- ``MAX_FILE_SIZE`` is the maxiumum file size allowed in asset upload (in mb)

### Running

- To create postgres container `make postgres`
- To create db `make createdb`
- To drop db `make dropdb`
- To generate documentation (You will need npm) `make generate_docs`

#### run `go mod tidy` to install packages
#### cli commands 
```
go run main.go migrate_up
go run main.go dropdb
go run main.go migrate_steps --steps int
go run main.go generate_docs
go run main.go runserver --host localhost --port port (localhost, 5000 are default)
```

#### to run migrations on the test database 
```
go run main.go migrate_up -t
go run main.go dropdb -t
go run main.go migrate_steps -t --steps int
```

### Use the Make file its your best friend 🛠
#### Make commands
##### If you are on windows please use git bash or wsl also you would have to install Make for windows
##### To install make for windows run `winget install GnuWin32.Make`

```shell
make postgres #creates docker container for postgres12
# reads env variables from app.env
make createdb #creates the db in the postgres container
make dropdb #drops the db
make migrate_up #migrates to the latest schema
make sqlc_generate #generates sqlc code if you write queries
make test # tests your code and shows coverage
#its a big output make sure to read it all
```

## 🐳 Running with Docker

Start the cdn `docker-compose up`

## 🚨 Tests
To test the cdn we can use two methods
```sh
make test
```
If you don't have make installed
```sh
go run main.go migrate_up -t
go test ./... -v 
```
**When you contribute, you need to add tests on the features you add.**
